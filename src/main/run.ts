 * renderer nor IPC handlers ever invent their own rules — they ask this module
 * what is allowed and dispatch named actions through {@link applyAction}.
 *

 * is pure and Electron-free so it can be unit-tested directly. The mutable
 * single-run controller at the bottom holds the dashboard's current run in
 * memory for this issue; the snapshot shape is serializable so it can later be
 * persisted to `.godmode/runs/` or SQLite without reshaping.
