/**
 * Reviewer launch composition (issue #10). This binds a run's **verified** PR
 * into the exact pointer-first prompts GodMode would write into each configured
 * reviewer session, plus the concise role-signed marker comment GodMode posts on
 * the PR after a reviewer session runs. Producing a plan never launches anything
 * — it is the auditable artifact behind the dashboard's reviewer pane, mirroring
 * the builder handoff (issue #8).
 *
 * Like the builder handoff, reviewer prompts are deliberately **pointer-first**:
 * GodMode is an agent harness, not a prompt-injection layer, so each reviewer is
 * directed to read the operated project's canonical sources (AGENTS.md, its role
 * doc) and the live PR diff/threads/checks itself via `gh` — rather than pasting
 * the full diff or PR thread into the prompt. Every source is scoped to the
 * **operated project** (the repo opened in GodMode), never the GodMode app repo.
 *
 * Launch is gated on a real bound PR **and** the run's commit verification being
 * `verified` (issue #9): plain PR existence or an agent self-report is never
 * enough evidence to start reviewers.
 *
 * The core here is pure and Electron/PTY/`gh`-free so it can be unit-tested
 * directly; the launch/capture/comment mechanics live in `src/main/index.ts`.
